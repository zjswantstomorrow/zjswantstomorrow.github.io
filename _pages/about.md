<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My research interest underwent two dramatic changes before shifting towards quantitative sociology: the first from natural sciences to social sciences, and the second from theory to empirical research. I look forward to mastering and developing certain methods, attempting to transform the knowledge of sociology into a contribution to society, and ultimately finding my own location outside of universities. 
I get the highest GPA in the Department of Sociology and have gone through some awesome research experience. More detailed information can be found on my CV. I have been trying to submit and publish my research findings recently.

My research interest includes historicalÂ sociology, social stratification and social network analysis.
